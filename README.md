# edgeworkers-curl

Shell script command wrapper for cURL to enable enhanced debug headers.

ewcurl is a simple wrapper to help triggering http requests against your Akamai property which enables your EdgeWorkers applications. The script intercepts a curl command argument in order to generate a EdgeWorkers trace token as a HTTP request header by using Akamai CLI command, then uses curl to trigger a HTTP request with the HTTP request header to enable EdgeWorkers enhanced debug headers for helping you to show yoru JavaScript debugging logs.

## CONFIGURATION

This script replies on Akamai CLI command and an `~/.edgerc` credentials file that needs to be created in your home directory and organized by [section] following the format below. Each [section] can contain a different credentials set allowing you to store all of your credentials in a single `~/.edgerc` file.

```
    [default]
    client_secret = xxxx
    host = xxxx # Note, don't include the https:// here
    access_token = xxxx
    client_token = xxxx
    max-body = xxxx

    [section1]
    client_secret = xxxx
    host = xxxx # Note, don't include the https:// here
    access_token = xxxx
    client_token = xxxx
    max-body = xxxx
```

Once you have the credentials set up you can use ewcurl.

Use the `-s` argument to specify which section from the configuration file contains the desired credentials for your Akamai CLI command in this script.
